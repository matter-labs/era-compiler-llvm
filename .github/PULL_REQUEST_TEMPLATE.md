## Purpose


## Ticket Number


## Requirements
- [ ] Have the requirements been met?
- [ ] Have stakeholder(s) approved the change?

## Implementation
- [ ] Does this code change accomplish what it is supposed to do?
- [ ] Can this solution be simplified?
- [ ] Does this change add unwanted compile-time or run-time dependencies?
- [ ] Could an additional framework, API, library, or service improve the solution?
- [ ] Could we reuse part of LLVM instead of implementing the patch or a part of it?
- [ ] Is the code at the right abstraction level?
- [ ] Is the code modular enough?
- [ ] Can a better solution be found in terms of maintainability, readability, performance, or security?
- [ ] Does similar functionality already exist in the codebase? If yes, why isn’t it reused?
- [ ] Are there any best practices, design patterns or language-specific patterns that could substantially improve this code? 

## Logic Errors and Bugs
- [ ] Can you think of any use case in which the
code does not behave as intended?
- [ ] Can you think of any inputs or external events
that could break the code?

## Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Is error handling done the correct way?
- [ ] Should any logging or debugging information
be added or removed?
- [ ] Are error messages user-friendly?
- [ ] Are there enough log events and are they
written in a way that allows for easy
debugging?

## Maintainability
- [ ] Is the code easy to read?
- [ ] Is the code not repeated (DRY Principle)?
- [ ] Is the code method/class not too long?

## Dependencies
- [ ] Were updates to documentation, configuration, or readme files made as required by this change?
- [ ] Are there any potential impacts on other parts of the system or backward compatibility?

## Security
- [ ] Does the code introduce any security vulnerabilities?

## Performance
- [ ] Do you think this code change decreases
system performance?
- [ ] Do you see any potential to improve the
performance of the code significantly?

## Testing and Testability
- [ ] Is the code testable?
- [ ] Have automated tests been added, or have related ones been updated to cover the change?
	- [ ] For changes to mutable state
- [ ] Do tests reasonably cover the code change (unit/integration/system tests)? 
	- [ ] Line Coverage
	- [ ] Region Coverage
	- [ ] Branch Coverage
- [ ] Are there some test cases, input or edge cases
that should be tested in addition?

## Readability
- [ ] Is the code easy to understand?
- [ ] Which parts were confusing to you and why?
- [ ] Can the readability of the code be improved by
smaller methods?
- [ ] Can the readability of the code be improved by
different function, method or variable names?
- [ ] Is the code located in the right
file/folder/package?
- [ ] Do you think certain methods should be
restructured to have a more intuitive control
flow?
- [ ] Is the data flow understandable?
- [ ] Are there redundant or outdated comments?
- [ ] Could some comments convey the message
better?
- [ ] Would more comments make the code more
understandable?
- [ ] Could some comments be removed by making the code itself more readable?
- [ ] Is there any commented-out code?

## Documentation
- [ ] Is there sufficient documentation?
- [ ] Is the ReadMe.md file up to date?

## Best Practices
- [ ] Follow Single Responsibility principle?
- [ ] Are different errors handled correctly?
- [ ] Are errors and warnings logged?
- [ ] Magic values avoided?
- [ ] No unnecessary comments?
- [ ] Minimal nesting used?

## Experts' Opinion
- [ ] Do you think a specific expert, like a security
expert or a usability expert, should look over
the code before it can be accepted?
- [ ] Will this code change impact different teams, and should they review the change as well?
